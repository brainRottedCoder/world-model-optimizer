"""Translate alternate enable-thinking Chat request shapes to canonical reasoning.

Clients express "turn thinking on" several non-canonical ways on
/v1/chat/completions: the Responses-style nested ``reasoning:{effort}``,
OpenRouter's unified ``reasoning:{enabled, max_tokens, exclude}``, the
Anthropic-style ``thinking:{type}`` (``enabled`` or ``adaptive``), the vLLM-native
``chat_template_kwargs:{enable_thinking}``, and DashScope's top-level
``enable_thinking``. Each is admitted and translated here to the canonical flat
``reasoning_effort`` (never dropped — dropping would leave thinking silently
off), so one caller payload works in any shape. The model-aware default effort
for a level-less enable is resolved later, at the route adaptation seam, via
``GatewayRequest.thinking_default_enable``.
